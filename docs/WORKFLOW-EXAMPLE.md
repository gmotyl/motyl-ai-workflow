## Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/note [project]` | Create session note (auto-initializes if needed) | `/note landingpage` |
| `/memo "text"` | Quick thought capture | `/memo "Fix navbar bug"` |
| `resume [project]` | Load project context + last session | `resume landingpage` |
| `session end` | Save progress + commit | `session end` |
| `standup [project]` | Daily standup preparation | `standup landingpage` |
| `/question` | Search project knowledge | `/question "How was navbar built?"` |

## Key Points

- **Automatic Session Tracking:** Each `session end` creates a progress file and commits automatically
- **Project Context:** Commands automatically detect which project you're working on
- **Quill Integration:** `/note meeting-name` searches for meetings and creates notes from minutes
- **No Manual File Management:** Everything is organized by the template structure
- **Resume Anywhere:** `resume [project]` loads context from your last session
