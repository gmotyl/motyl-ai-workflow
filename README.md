## 🎯 What is motyl-ai-workflow?

A **provider-agnostic** project management template designed for developers managing multiple projects (personal, work, freelance).

Choose **any AI provider for any project** based on your needs, budget, and preferences:
- Personal project with Kilocode? ✓ Your choice
- Personal project with Claude? ✓ Your choice
- Work project with Copilot? ✓ Your choice
- Work project with QWEN? ✓ Your choice

**Same workflow structure. Infinite provider flexibility.** Switch providers anytime—just update one config file.

## 🤔 Why motyl-ai-workflow?

### The Problem

Managing multiple projects across different contexts is complex:
- You have personal projects you want to explore freely
- You have work projects your company sponsors tools for
- You want to leverage AI agents, but not be locked into one provider
- You need a consistent workflow across all projects, regardless of the AI tool

### The Solution

**One workflow structure. Any AI provider.**

- **Provider-agnostic:** Works with Claude Code, Kilocode CLI, GitHub Copilot, QWEN, Gemini, and any future AI agent
- **Project-level configuration:** Choose your provider per project in `.agent/config.json`
- **Easy switching:** Change providers by updating one config file—no workflow changes
- **Full integration:** Todoist, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jira, and NotebookLM support
- **Clear examples:** See how to organize projects with different providers

## 📁 What You Get

- **Folder structure** for organizing notes, decisions, progress tracking
- **Example projects** showing how to use the workflow
- **Project generator** (`create-project.sh`) to scaffold new projects quickly
- **Setup scripts** for each provider and integration
- **Comprehensive documentation** on provider selection, switching, and daily workflow
- **NotebookLM integration** for architectural analysis and planning
- **Sound notifications** support for your chosen AI agent

## 🎨 Example Projects

Two example projects demonstrate the flexibility:

```

    ├── .agent/config.json        # { "provider": "claude" }
    └── ...
```

Review these to understand the folder structure and workflow patterns.
