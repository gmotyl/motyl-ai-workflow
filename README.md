## 🎯 What is motyl-ai-workflow?

A **provider-agnostic** project management template designed for developers managing multiple projects (personal, work, freelance).

Choose **any AI provider for any project** based on your needs, budget, and preferences:
- Personal project with Kilocode? ✓ Your choice
- Personal project with Claude? ✓ Your choice
- Work project with Copilot? ✓ Your choice
- Work project with Gemini? ✓ Your choice

**Same workflow structure. Infinite provider flexibility.** Switch providers anytime—just update one config file.

## 🤔 Why motyl-ai-workflow?

### The Problem

Managing multiple projects across different contexts is complex:
- You have personal projects you want to explore freely
- You have work projects your company sponsors tools for
- You want to leverage AI agents, but not be locked into one provider
- You need a consistent workflow across all projects, regardless of the AI tool

### The Solution

**One workflow structure. Any AI provider.**

- **Provider-agnostic:** Works with Claude Code, Kilocode CLI, GitHub Copilot, QWEN, Gemini, and any future AI agent
- **Project-level configuration:** Choose your provider per project in `.agent/config.json`
- **Easy switching:** Change providers by updating one config file—no workflow changes
- **Full integration:** Todoist, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jira, and NotebookLM support
- **Clear examples:** See how to organize projects with different providers

## 📁 What You Get

- **Folder structure** for organizing notes, decisions, progress tracking
- **Example projects** showing how to use the workflow
- **Project generator** (`create-project.sh`) to scaffold new projects quickly
- **Setup scripts** for each provider and integration
- **Comprehensive documentation** on provider selection, switching, and daily workflow
- **NotebookLM integration** for architectural analysis and planning
- **Sound notifications** support for your chosen AI agent

## 🚀 Supported Providers

First-class support:
- ✅ Claude Code (with peon-ping notifications)
- ✅ Kilocode CLI
- ✅ GitHub Copilot

Additional providers:
- ✅ QWEN
- ✅ Gemini
- ✅ Custom/Any other agent

**Not locked to any provider.** Add support for your favorite tools.

## 🎨 Example Projects

Two example projects demonstrate the flexibility:

```
examples/
├── example-personal-project/     # Your choice of provider
│   ├── .agent/config.json        # { "provider": "kilocode" }
│   └── ...
│
└── example-work-project/         # Your choice of provider
    ├── .agent/config.json        # { "provider": "claude" }
    └── ...
```

Review these to understand the folder structure and workflow patterns.

## 📋 Project Registry & Multi-Provider Support

This workspace supports **ANY AI provider** with proper configuration files in the right locations.

**Core files (workspace root):**
- **`AGENTS.md`** - Project registry + provider overview
- **`docs/PROVIDER-SETUP.md`** - COMPLETE setup guide for ALL providers
- **`docs/PROJECT-SETUP-GUIDE.md`** - General project setup guide
- **`templates/`** - Configuration templates for each provider

**When you create a project**, the correct files are generated for your chosen provider:

| Provider | Files Generated | Session Tracking |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/settings.json` | ✅ Automatic |
| **Kilocode** | `opencode.json` | ✅ Automatic |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Manual |
| **QWEN** | `.qwen/settings.json` | Manual |
| **Google Gemini** | `.gemini/settings.json` | Manual |

**Key Point:** Each provider expects config files in **specific locations** with **specific formats**. This template generates them correctly.

See [**PROVIDER-SETUP.md**](docs/PROVIDER-SETUP.md) for:
- Exact file locations for each provider
- Configuration file examples
- Session tracking setup
- Global vs project-level settings
- How to switch providers mid-project
